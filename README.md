I built this app for myself. I don't plan on distributing it, but if you want to use it, reach out to `me@madebysid.com`, and I'll send it to you.

### Building

- `yarn start` will start a dev server to transpile TS
- `yarn open` will open a development version of the app

You'd ideally need both these commands running on two terminal tabs to work efficiently.

- `yarn package` will package the app to a `.app` file for macOS. I haven't tested this for Linux or Windows, but I think they'll work.

### Contributing

The codebase is tiny, just start at `src/main/index.ts`, and you should immediately understand what is happening. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, though.
